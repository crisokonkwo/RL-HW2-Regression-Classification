# RL-HW2-Regression-Classification
Training a linear classifier on the MNIST dataset, by fitting a line using least squares. Since regression works best when there are two classes only, we will apply regression to each pair of classes. MNIST has 10 classes (10 digits), so the total number of regressors you train will be (10 choose 2) = 45.
